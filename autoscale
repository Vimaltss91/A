I've reviewed the script for the install, upgrade, and rollback phases, and it seems to work as intended. During the install phase, the script will query the data and assign the appropriate namespace. In the upgrade phase, when the script queries the data again, it will fetch the same data, recognizing that the namespace has already been assigned. Therefore, it will continue using the existing namespace.
