Hi Tukaram,

As expected, we have only built the bulwark, notifier, and nwdaf services from the policy, which is why the job fails with the message that the image doesn't exist.

The one-click contract test triggers the pipeline based on the policy_release_tag, meaning it attempts to build all services with the same tag (e.g., 24.2.2) without much intelligence.

Youâ€™ll notice that the query server, app-info, and config-server are common services, which we are still using from the previous version.
