In OCI, namespaces are deleted if there are no final failures. Even in the case of a final failure, the namespace is retained for a maximum of three days.

We should either set the delete_namespace option to false or use an automation script to capture the timing information and share it in the thread for official builds.

We are currently using Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) and have encountered an issue as part of our cleanup process. Specifically, during the cleanup of all events, pods, and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for a namespace, we observe that some PVCs get stuck in the termination state indefinitely.

This issue does not occur consistently but has been happening with increasing frequency. From the logs, it appears that both the PVCs and the associated pods are deleted as expected. However, despite this, certain PVCs remain in a termination state and fail to fully complete the deletion process.

We have attached the relevant logs for further reference to help analyze this issue.

Hi Team,

As we move to automated namespace allocation, the pipeline will enter a queued state once CPU threshold limits are reached. Notifications will be sent to the respective channel when this happens. The NS status in the UI will display as QUEUED, so please keep an eye on it, especially for priority deployments. Once resources become available, the namespace will be allocated, and the deployment will start automatically.

Please remember to clean up the entry from the UI using the Delete button after the deployment is completed.

I had a discussion with Benson today regarding the Python virtual repository. To build the Python package with manylinux, further research is needed, and it will take some time. Meanwhile, Benson suggested we check if we can pull the three required packages by defining the open-source repository on our side.
