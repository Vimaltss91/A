If the Viking team has updated the SB version, we need to refer to the vikingcatalog tag. By removing the hardcoded catalog tag from the schedule, the build will default to using the catalog from the dev branch. However, as we release new common versions, the catalog parameter is also updated and needs to be reflected in the schedule. The schedule must always point to the corresponding catalog version, whether itâ€™s a full build or an individual build, especially when there are changes due to catalog updates.
