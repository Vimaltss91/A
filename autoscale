As per my understanding, we need to check how the Spring Boot plugins are built for BFS. (Maybe we can check with Benson.)
If it is published only as a JAR, the dependencies need to be hardcoded like this.
If it is built as a plugin with an ID, we need to check its plugin ID to define the repository accordingly.

My guess is that it might be built as a JAR only, but I will confirm this with Benson.
