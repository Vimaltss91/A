My comments above pertain to a different issue related to TPD changes for notifications. However, for the one-click support, my understanding is that thereâ€™s no need to create a patch branch. All existing patch branches (e.g., 23.4.x-patch) are already pointing to the dev branch. Even if we introduce a new variable, it will appear as empty in the ATS.
