The above-mentioned location is actually the Spring Boot plugin JAR.
However, if the Spring Boot plugin is built and published with a plugin ID, we can use that plugin ID to reference the actual POM.
If only the JAR exists and the plugin is not published with a plugin ID, we need to hardcode the Spring Boot plugin JAR as a dependency.
