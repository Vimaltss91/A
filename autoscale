Subject: Python/Node Virtual Repository for Open Source Build

Hi Ivan,

We’ve set up a Python virtual repository that prioritizes our opensource-release repository, with a fallback to the OCI PyPI registry (which mirrors the public PyPI). The goal is to pull all packages from the opensource-release repo. However, there are transitive dependencies that haven’t been built from source, and those are currently being fetched from the OCI PyPI registry.

This setup is similar to how we configure precedence in build.gradle for Java builds—where we prioritize the opensource repo, but still allow resolution from repo1 for transitive dependencies.

Please let us know if you have any concerns.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
