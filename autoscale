I’ve attempted to build the package and discussed the issue with Benson. Here are the key points:

TGZ Format Issue:
The pipeline currently supports only ZIP format for source code, which is why the build is failing when using TGZ.

Workaround:
As a temporary solution (pending Benson's confirmation), I extracted the TGZ source code and repackaged it as a ZIP file.

Faced an issue with the POM URL provided by the user—it wasn’t accepted.
As a result, the manifest/JSON file was created manually.
Additionally, there’s a unit test failure due to connection issues, which has prevented the JAR file from being pushed.
