The workaround build requires confirmation from Benson. Since we're extracting the .tgz file and repackaging it as a .zip, he mentioned it might cause checksum issues. Additionally, the manifest is currently generated without any dependencies, so this build includes only the main package.


One more thingâ€”can you confirm which version of the opensaml-security-api package we're building? Is it version 5.1.3 or 4.3.2?
