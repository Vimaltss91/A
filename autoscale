Hi Team,

We recently received additional CPU resources in the E5 shape. However, we are currently utilizing the X7 shape in our compartment, primarily for our OKE cluster. Unfortunately, our executions are not performing as expected with the new E5 shape, which may be attributed to differences in processor architecture or frequency rates.

We would like to request a replacement of the E5 shape with the X7 shape to ensure optimal performance.
