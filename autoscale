BuildSrc Module:
Should we name the project bom-dependencies for the BuildSrc module?

Shared JARs:
The nrf-common JAR has been renamed to cnc-ocnrf-common, and a new JAR, cnc-jetty-client, has been introduced. Corresponding changes have been made in the common-service-handlers project/TPD.
However, it's unclear whether other common service JARs have also been renamed using the "CNC" prefix. For example, it appears that the GW module has been renamed to use the "cnc" prefix.
Should we adopt the "CNC" naming convention consistently across all NF modules?
