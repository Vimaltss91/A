Hi Benson,

Some of the NPM packages built from source and pushed to the repository are corrupted, which may cause build failures. I understand that we have some validation in place for Java packages before they are pushed.

Could you please check if any additional validation is required for NPM packages as well?

Below are some of the corrupted packages that were removed from the release/dev open-source repository:

lodash

Our pipeline attempted to consume the NPM package, but it failed due to the corruption.

Thanks,
