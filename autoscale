Previously, we utilized the VM.Standard.E3.Flex shape, which worked seamlessly with ATS. However, due to host unavailability issues with the E3 shape, we transitioned to the X7 shape as recommended by SWATGO.


### Auto Namespace Management for Parallel Execution/Deployment

To support parallel execution and deployment, the following enhancements have been made:

---

#### **Database Modifications**
Two new columns are added to the MySQL database to manage parallel deployment configurations:
1. **`parallel_execution`**: Accepts values `Yes` or `No` to indicate if the deployment supports parallel execution.
2. **`parallel_count`**: Holds integer values (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc.) to uniquely identify rows for each parallel deployment instance.

---

#### **Pipeline Parameters**
The **one-click-play pipeline** now includes the following parameters:

1. **`PARALLEL_PKG_TYPE`**: Defines the deployment type. Possible values are:
   - `tgz`: For TGZ package deployments.
   - `csar`: For CSAR package deployments.
   - `asm`: For ASM package deployments.
   - `external`: For external deployments.

2. **Namespace Parameters for Parallel Deployment**:
   - **CSAR Parallel Deployment**:
     - `CSAR_ASM_POLICY_NAMESPACE_1`
     - `CSAR_ASM_POLICY_NAMESPACE_2`
     - `CSAR_ASM_POLICY_NAMESPACE_3`
   - **ASM Parallel Deployment**:
     - `ASM_POLICY_NAMESPACE_1`
     - `ASM_POLICY_NAMESPACE_2`
     - `ASM_POLICY_NAMESPACE_3`
   - **TGZ Parallel Deployment**:
     - `TGZ_POLICY_NAMESPACE_1`
     - `TGZ_POLICY_NAMESPACE_2`
     - `TGZ_POLICY_NAMESPACE_3`
   - **External Parallel Deployment**:
     - `POLICY_NAMESPACE_1`
     - `POLICY_NAMESPACE_2`
     - `POLICY_NAMESPACE_3`

---

#### **Pipeline Behavior**
1. **Triggering Parallel Deployment**:
   - In the `export_downstream_job`, for each parallel deployment, three rows are inserted into the database with identical parameter values.
   - Each row has a unique `parallel_count` value (`1`, `2`, or `3`).

2. **Namespace Assignment**:
   - During deployment, the pipeline fetches the appropriate row for each `parallel_count`.
   - The namespace is assigned sequentially based on the `parallel_count` value.

---

#### **Other Features**
All other features and functionalities remain consistent with the existing deployment process.
