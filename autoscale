Hi team,
In OKE, modifying the default scheduler (e.g., setting NodeResourcesFit to MostAllocated for bin-packing) is not supported, as the control plane is managed by Oracle.
To achieve bin-packing, deploy a custom scheduler with the MostAllocated strategy or use a mutating webhook to route pods to it by default.

sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/bus
systemctl --user start podman.socket
systemctl --user enable podman.socket
machinectl shell $USER@  # provides full user session
