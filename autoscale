Pre-condition: Namespace values should be passed as "auto" for all deployments.
Expected Behavior:
(i) The "auto" parameter will be detected as OCI, and the bastion details will be simplified.
(ii) When the "auto" value is passed, data will be fed to the database in the export_down_test job. In the load_bastion parameter, data will be retrieved and conditions will be checked to assign the namespace.
