### 🔍 How to Check Node Logs for Debugging

1. **Identify the Node Hosting the Pod**  
   To determine which node a specific pod was running on, use a Prometheus query.  
   - **Get the Prometheus link**:  
     Run the script from the OCCNP deployment tools repository:  
     ```bash
     ./occnp-deployment-tools/master/public/script.sh
     ```
   - **Query Example**:
     ```promql
     kube_pod_info{namespace="o-devops-pol9", pod=~"o-devops-pol9-occnp-alternate-route.*"}
     ```
   - Modify the time window in the Prometheus UI based on when the issue occurred to locate the relevant pod's node IP.

2. **Log into the Worker Node**
   - Use the obtained **node IP**.
   - For OCI environments:
     - Use the **same private key** as the bastion.
     - The **username** is usually `opc`.

3. **Fetch the Logs**
   Use the `journalctl` command to extract logs within the required time range:
   ```bash
   journalctl --since "2025-04-22 21:03" --until "2025-04-22 21:06" > debug.log
   ```
   - You can adjust the time range or filter the logs further as needed.
